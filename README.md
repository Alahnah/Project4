# Project4

# Our proposal for Project 4 is to create a model to predict if a job posting is legitimate or a phishing scam. We will use a large dataset of 18 thousand job listings known to be real or fake, and create a model using machine learning techniques to predict the legitimacy of future job listings. Our project will identify key words and phrases to identify a likely phishing scam, and run models to identify similar job descriptions. We also plan to scrape websites like Indeed, LinkedIn, and Glassdoor to grab more info in real time. This project can be useful in our future job searches to ensure we devote our time to legitimate applications and protect us from having our sensitive information compromised.
