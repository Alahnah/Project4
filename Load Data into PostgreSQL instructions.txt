1.Open PostgreSQL and right-click “Database”, click “Create…”, name “job_postings_df”, click “Save”

2. Right-click the new database, select “Query Tool”. Paste the SQL code from “ERD/SQL Database Code” into the query. While still highlighted, hit “Execute/Refresh” (play button on top dashboard)

3. In the Schemas/Tables tab on the left, hit Refresh. Be sure that all seven tables are seen.

4.Begin importing data. Right-click “Country”, go to “Import/Export Data” be sure that the correct dataset is chosen. Then import data.

5. Repeat for all tables EXCEPT for JobPosting. You must import the data for this table last.

6. Once at JobPosting, be sure to import the dataset “job_merged_transformed_df”. This is the only correct one.

7. Once data is imported, run a test such as SELECT * FROM “Country” to ensure the data is successfully loaded. 

8. That’s it! You are free to query the database.

Example Queries:
	SELECT * FROM "Country"

This gives a list of all the countries in the database and their ID numbers

	SELECT country_id, COUNT(*) AS "fraudulent"
	FROM "JobPosting"
	WHERE "fraudulent" = true
	GROUP BY "country_id"
	ORDER BY "country_id"

This shows the country ID of fraudulent job postings, and gives the number of fraudulent job listings from each country. As we can see, 730 fake job postings were from the United States (country_id=1), 23 from Great Britain(country_id=4), and so on.
